    "Microbes are ideal organisms for exploring 'Long-term Evolution Experiments' (LTEEs) - thousands of generations can be generated and stored in a way that would be virtually impossible for more complex eukaryotic systems. In Blount et al 2012, 12 populations of Escherichia coli were propagated for more than 40,000 generations in a glucose-limited minimal medium. This medium was supplemented with citrate which E. coli cannot metabolize in the aerobic conditions of the experiment.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequencing of the populations at regular time points reveals that spontaneous citrate-using mutants (Cit+) appeared in a population of E.coli (designated Ara-3) at around 31,000 generations. It should be noted that spontaneous Cit+ mutants are extraordinarily rare - inability to metabolize citrate is one of the defining characters of the E. coli species. Eventually, Cit+ mutants became the dominant population as the experimental growth medium contained a high concentration of citrate relative to glucose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strains from generation 0 to generation 40,000 were sequenced, including ones that were both Cit+ and Cit- after generation 31,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this workshop we're going to be working with 6 of the sequence reads from this experiment. We also made up genome sizes for each of the strains, to look at the relationship between Cit status and genome size. The genome sizes are not real data!!\n",
