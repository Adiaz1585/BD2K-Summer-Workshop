    "The shell is a basic but powerful way to interact with your computer's operating system. Running commands in a shell can be more difficult at first, but once you become more familiar with the basic commands you will find that you have much more freedom in the way you solve computing tasks. Also, most cutting-edge research tools are first developed for shell interfaces. The shell is where you input commands on the command line.\n",
