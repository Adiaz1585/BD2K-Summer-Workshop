    "\n",
    "The command line is the shell interface. The shell is a basic but powerful way to interact with your computer's operating system. Running commands in a shell can be more difficult at first, but once you become more familiar with the basic commands you will find that you have much more freedom in the way you solve computing tasks. Also, most cutting-edge research tools are first developed for shell interfaces. The shell is where you input commands on the command line. There are many shells you can use. The most popular shell is called bash, but other popular shells include zsh, csh, and tcsh. We are going to use bash here. How you start a shell session depends on your operating system. Basically, macs and linux computers have a terminal program by default, but windows users will need to download a client.\n",

    "We're going to be working with data on a remote linux server. The interface is entirely in text, so we will need to use the command line. Log onto your server using SSH and then we are going to explore the filesystem. The first command we are going to look at is **ls** - list directory contents\n",
